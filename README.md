# Lockdown List

I've decided to make this list for people who pay for things like Netflix and Disney+ etc. But, the thing is, these platforms are:

1. Expensive, especially when you have to pay for 2-3 services.
2. Limited in content.

So, this list is a guide to the **free** Apps and Websites that I use day-to-day to watch all the same shows as everyone else. I will try to cover as much as possible in the list. 

Please, if you have any difficulty with setting anything up, drop me a DM @lpf.jordy on IG and i'll get back to you. 
Also, please feel free to recommend anything you use in the comments or through a message to me and i'll add it to the list. 

## Section 1: Setup
The first thing you'll need is an AdBlocker. Whether you're on a Phone or a Computer, AdBlockers will change your life! 
I use two different AdBlockers on my devices, which are: 

1. uBlock Origin for Chrome Desktop
2. AdGuard for my Samsung Galaxy S9

### uBlock Origin for Desktop
To install uBlock Origin, visit [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-GB) on your Desktop and add the Chrome Extension to your Browser. 
This may not seem useful now, however, further down in the list I will put some examples of Websites with and without uBlock protection.

### AdGuard for Android Devices
To install AdGuard for your Android device you need to do a few simple steps:

1. On your device browser, go to [AdGuard Website](https://adguard.com/en/download.html) and click the **Download** button
2. When the file downloads, click on it and install it.
3. If you do not already have access to unknown apps turned on within your settings, go to Settings > Apps > Click the 3 dots in the tp right on the screen > Special Access
4. Scroll down until you see the App and click the toggle button beside the App name to turn on Special Access
