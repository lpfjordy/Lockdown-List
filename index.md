## Lockdown List

I've decided to make this list for people who pay for things like Netflix and Disney+ etc. But, the thing is, these platforms are:

1. Expensive, especially when you have to pay for 2-3 services.
2. Limited in content.

So, this list is a guide to the **free** Apps and Websites that I use day-to-day to watch all the same shows as everyone else. I will try to cover as much as possible in the list. 

### Setup
The first thing you'll need is an AdBlocker. Whether you're on a Phone or a Computer, AdBlockers will change your life! 
I use two different AdBlockers on my devices, which are: 

1. uBlock Origin for Chrome Desktop
2. AdGuard for my Samsung Galaxy S9

#### uBlock Origin
To install uBlock, go to the following link
